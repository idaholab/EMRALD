Event-Modeled Risk Assessment using Linked Diagrams (EMRALD) 

Event Modeling Risk Assessment using Linked Diagrams (EMRALD) is a software tool developed at INL for researching the capabilities of dynamic PRA (Probabilistic Risk Assessment). In order to promote the effective use of dynamic PRA by the general community, EMRALD focuses on the following key aspects: Simplifying the modeling process by providing a structure that corresponds to traditional PRA modeling methods Providing a user interface (UI) that makes it easy for the user to model and visualize complex interactions Allowing the user to couple with other analysis applications such as physics based simulations. This includes one-way communication for most applications and two-way loose coupling for customizable applications Providing the sequence and timing of events that lead to the specified outcomes when calculating results Traditional aspects of components with basic events, fault trees, and event trees are all captured in a dynamic framework of state diagrams, which are displayed

## SETUP
1. Clone this repository to your machine using `git clone https://github.com/inl-labtrack/EMRALD.git`
	- To avoid unexpected problems during setup, it is strongly recommended to NOT use Visual Studio to clone the repository
2. When the cloning is complete, open "EMRALD.sln" in Visual Studio
3. In Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, there will be several projects listed.  These are detailed in [EMRALD Projects](#emrald-projects) section below.  The three primary projects are the website used for building models, the desktop application used for running simulations, and the documentation project for getting started with EMRALD and learning how to use it.
	- To run (debug) the Website project:
		1. After loading the solution in Visual Studio and all packages have been restored, run the `RunFirst.bat` file in the `Emrald_Site` folder. (This step should only need to be done once.)
			1. To run this file from Visual Studio, right-click on the `Emrald_Site` project and select `Open in Terminal`.  
			2. In the terminal window that appears, type `.\RunFirst.bat` and hit enter.
			3. This will copy the needed dependencies for the Emrald_Site project that could not be restored by Visual Studio
			4. Upon completion, a success message should appear.
		2. Right-click on "Emrald_Site" in the Solution Explorer
		3. Select "View in Browser"
	- To run (debug) the Simulator Project: 
		1. Right-click on "EMRALD_Sim" in the Solution Explorer
		2. Under "Debug," select "Start New Instance"
    - To run the Documentation Project:
        1. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) (This will also install npm)
        2. Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the "emrald-docs" directory (i.e. \EMRALD\emrald-docs) in a terminal window (such as Command Prompt)
        3. Run the commmand `npm install` to install the project's dependencies
        4. Start the local dev server by running the command `npm run dev`
        5. Once the server is running, this message should appear: `VuePress dev server listening at http://localhost:8080/`
        6. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view the EMRALD Documentation.
	- To build the offline executable:
		1. Install C++ Build Tools, from within Visual Studio or from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
		2. Install WebView2 by downloading the Evergreen Standalone Installer from [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)
		3. Install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
		4. Install Node.js & NPM from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
		5. Build dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory
		6. Build the executable by running `npm build` in the root directory
