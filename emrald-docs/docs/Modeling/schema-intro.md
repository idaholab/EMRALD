# Introduction

The following documentation outlines the schema used for the EMRALD JSON model. The documentation outlines how the data for various parts of the application are stored and what parameters are used for in the model. You can click on any properties in the schema to view details of that property. If modifying the EMRALD model by hand or programatically, verify against the schema before saving. The latest schema is located in the EMRALD-UI project src/utils/upgrades/v[X]/EMRALD_JsonSchemaV[X].json
