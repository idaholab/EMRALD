This can be used in situations where you want to use and store values in a separate document for use in multiple EMRALD models or if you want to draw data from output files created by an external executable. The editor window for a document link variable has additional fields which are shown and explained below.<br><img src="'+g+'" alt="Document Link Variable Editor Window"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Document Type (Doc Type):</strong> Click the dropdown menu and select one of three options for the document type that your variable is in: XML, JSON, and Text RegEx (text file using regular expression). Make sure to change this document type before proceeding to fill out any of the other fields as this will change the Tester link to be discussed in that following bullet point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Document Path (Doc Path):</strong> Type or copy and paste the path to the document. For example, C:\\Projects\\EMRALDVariables\\DocLink.json.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tester:</strong> Click this link to test if your variable link, to be put in the following field, works properly. This link will bring you to a website that will allow you to input your document and expression for testing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Variable Link (Var Link):</strong> Identify the variable in the document using the matching syntax to the document type you are using. For example, if your document type is a JSON file, use JSONPath syntax. The Tester link includes an example of how to link to the variable from your document in the corresponding syntax. There are two extra settings available for linking to a text file using regular expression explained below. <img src="'+f+'" alt="Regular Expression Document Link Variable Editor Window"></p><ul><li><strong>Doc Path and Var Link must exist on startup:</strong> Check this box if the document and link must exist upon startup of the simulation. You would not want this checked if the document is created during the running of the EMRALD model when an external executable is triggered/coupled to and a variable from that output file is to be used.</li><li><strong>Line #:</strong> Check this box if you would like to use the value in a line after the regular expression match rather than the same line as the regular expression match. Indexing begins at 0 so you would use 0 to indicate the same line and 1 to indicate the next line. When this box is checked, two additional settings appear: Beginning Position and Number of Characters.</li><li><strong>Beginning Position (Beg Pos):</strong> This is the line start position. Indexing begins at 0. To use the first character in the line, type 0.</li><li><strong>Number of Characters (Num Chars):</strong> Use this to indicate the relative position of the last character you would like to extract. Set this value to 0 to only use the character in the beginning position, 1 if you would like to use the first two characters starting with the one in the beginning position, and so on. Do not check this box if you would just like to select everything up through the end of the line.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Default:</strong> The value to be returned if no match is found in the document via the variable link.</p></li></ul><h3 id="accrual-variable" tabindex="-1">Accrual Variable <a class="header-anchor" href="#accrual-variable" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Accrual Variable&quot;">​</a></h3><p>An accrual variable allows the user to easily adjust a variable depending on how much time is spent in specified states. For example, determining a radiation dose rate or costs for procedures or downtime. Accumulation variables are always doubles. Follow these steps to set up an accrual variable.</p><p>The initial editor screen when changing the scope to Accrual immediately changes and locks the variable type as a double. It also shows a blank table of State Accrual Variables. These are the states that will influence the value of the variable depending on how long the state is occupied. <img src="'+v+'" style="width:400px;"></p><p>To add a state to the tabulated list, click and drag the state of interest from the Left Navigation Frame to the area where it says Drag States Here. Release your mouse once the row appears green. <img src="'+w+'"></p><p>The state should also appear in the table. You will have the option to make it either a Static or Dynamic response. The default is Static which means that the Accrual Rate is constant. The Accrual Rate is the rate at which the variable increases based on the time spent in the state. The value input is the amount the variable will accrue per the time unit on the right. The unit can be changed as seen in the dropdown menu between days, hours, minute, and seconds. <img src="'+y+'" style="width:400px;"></p><p>To switch to the Dynamic type, select the radio button for &quot;Dynamic.&quot; The Dynamic type means that the accrual rate will vary with respect to the simulation time passed. For example, if you want the accrual rate to change after the first ten hours of simulation time, you can define the rate for the first ten hours then the rate for the remaining time. The simulation time is the time at which the accrual rate changes to the value input. This rate will carry out for the rest of the simulation time unless otherwise specified. Like in the Static type, the unit can be changed for both the simulation time and accrual rate. When the unit is changed for one, it will change it for both. They must be the same unit. <img src="'+x+'" style="width:600px;"></p><p>As you can see, there is no area immediately present to add values in for the rate. Click the button &quot;Add Row&quot; to add a row for entering the rate. <img src="'+_+'" style="width:600px;"></p><p>To add additional rows, click the [+] button on the right-hand side of the accrual rate field or the same &quot;Add Row&quot; button. The [+] button will add an additional row immediately underneath that row. The &quot;Add Row&quot; button will add a row to the bottom of the grid. <img src="'+k+'" style="width:600px;"></p><p>To delete a row, click the [X] button on the right-hand side of the [+] button.</p><p>To collapse the rows for the state, click the &quot;HIDE TABLE&quot; button. <img src="'+q+'" style="width:600px;"></p><p>The button will change to an &quot;Expand Table&quot; button.
