These pieces correlate to aspects of traditional PRA modeling and range from small-scale components to a large scope, overall plant response and design. The scope of the diagram indicates the type of diagram: Single State or Multi State. The single state or multi state type indicates whether or not the diagram can be in multiple states at once or not. A diagram contains multiple states with the events that can occur, actions that can be executed and variables used. These all define how the simulation may sift through the diagram over time. Single State diagrams can also be evaluated to a Boolean depending on which state they are currently in. This is a main feature that when combined with a Component Logic Event, can greatly simplify a model. Unlike the more general Multi State diagrams, these diagrams are restricted to only be in one state at a time, in order to execute the evaluation process.</p><h2 id="creating-a-new-diagram" tabindex="-1">Creating a New Diagram <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-new-diagram" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating a New Diagram&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the left Navigation Frame, right click on &quot;Diagrams&quot; and select &quot;New Diagram&quot; from the drop down menu. <br><img src="'+l+'" alt="Right Click for New Diagram" style="width:300px;"></p><p>Or select &quot;New Diagram&quot; from the right side drop down menu. <img src="'+m+'" alt="Click New Diagram" style="width:300px;"></p><p>There are three options when filling out the form, all seen in the properties window. <img src="'+d+'" alt="New Diagram Dialogue Box" style="width:500px;"></p><p><strong>Option 1 (Create Diagram):</strong> Fill out the dialogue box.

System diagrams function just like a component diagram, but with some unique characteristics. However, both component and system diagrams are Single State Diagrams and have a boolean evaluation.<br></p><p>A system diagram only needs two states, active and failed.

When the demand event for the pump's use is triggered, the pump either moves to active or failed depending on random sampling.

When in the active state, a failure rate event would sample and determine when the pump will fail and move to the failed state. This is equivalent to a "Fails to Run" basic event in traditional PRA. In this example, a stop event resets or returns the pump to the standby state. `),P])}const V=n(S,[["render",C]]);export{L as __pageData,V as default};
