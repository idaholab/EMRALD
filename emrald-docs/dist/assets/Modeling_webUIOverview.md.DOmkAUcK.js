However, these categories can be customized by the currently open model or for specific modeling needs. Double clicking on the folders will expand them to reveal the inidividual diagrams. Double clicking on the individual diagrams will open them in the Modeling Area.</p><p>Each diagram represents a particular piece of the model and the various conditions or states that this piece of the model can be in. These pieces correlate to aspects of traditional PRA modeling and range from small-scale components to a large scope, overall plant response and design. A diagram contains multiple states with the events that can occur, actions that can be executed and variables used. These all define how the simulation may sift through the diagram over time.</p><p>Additionally, some diagrams, Component and State, can also be evaluated to a Boolean depending on which stat they are currently in. This is a main feature that when combined with a Component Logic Event, can greatly simplify a model. Unlike the more general plant response diagrams, these diagrams are restricted to only be in one state at a time, in order to execute the evaluation process.</p><p>Breif descriptions of each diagram type will be explained below but for more information, see <a href="/Modeling/diagrams.html">Diagrams</a>.</p><ul><li><p>Plant<br></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="Diagrams Plant Expanded"> <br> These diagrams are the main scenarios to be evaluated, similar to Event Trees in traditional PRA. This diagram has a starting state called Normal Operation. Other states do general evaluation and movement or be a key end state. Here the user defines the various states and events that drive the simulation from an initial start state and events to a desired key state. <br></p></li><li><p>Component<br></p><p><img src="'+v+'" alt="Diagrams Component Expanded"> <br> All aspects of a component should be captured in a simple Component Diagram. PRA Basic Events are captured by events in one of the component states. Events can be shared between different components for a &quot;common cause&quot; effect. Component diagrams are required to be &quot;Single State Diagrams&quot; meaning the simulation can only be in one of those states at any given time. Each State has a Boolean evaluation value, which can represent things like OK or Failed. <br></p></li><li><p>System<br><img src="'+y+'" alt="Diagrams System Expanded"> <br> System Diagrams are mainly just a catigorization, but behave similarly to component diagrams. A Fault Tree from traditional modeling could be directly converted into System diagram with just two states and a &quot;Component Logic&quot; event used to determine the boolean logic from component diagrams. See <a href="/Modeling/logicTree.html">Logic Trees</a> and <a href="/Modeling/events.html">Events</a> for more information. The two states for this diagram are &quot;Active&quot; and &quot;Failed&quot;, with a &quot;Component Logic&quot; event in the active state evaluating the assigned logic whenever a component diagram state changes. If the logic ever evaluates to false, then the current state shifts from &quot;Active&quot; to &quot;Failed&quot;. This is similar to a typical PRA model except the logic does not contain any probabilities, just references to the Component diagrams.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Logic Tree</strong> <br> All of logic trees are accessible in this section.
