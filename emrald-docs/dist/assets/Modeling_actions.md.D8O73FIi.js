A transition action in the &quot;Immediate Actions&quot; list (See <a href="#immediate-and-event-actions">Immediate and Event Actions</a> for more information) will always be adding to the current states because there is no event with an exit property and it would be bad modeling to exit a state immediately after entering, making it possible for other immediate actions to not be executed.</p><img src="'+L+'" alt="Transition Action Options" width="500"><ul><li><strong>Mutually Exclusive:</strong> Check this box if you would like the action to transition to one and only one of the states in the list.
