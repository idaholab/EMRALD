# EMRALD_Site Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the EMRALD site source code.

To view the documentation, simply open [index.html](./index.html) in your web browser.

HTML files are automatically generated by [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).

## Building Documentation
Documentation can be rebuilt using the following command (executed relative to the Emrald_Site folder):
```
npx jsdoc ./scripts -d documentation
```
This command is currently intended only to be run using source files located in the [jsdoc GitHub branch](https://github.com/idaholab/EMRALD/tree/jsdoc), as only these files are correctly annotated for JSDoc. Generating documentation in the main or any other branch will result in incorrect output.
